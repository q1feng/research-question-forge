# Maintenance guide

[简体中文](maintenance-guide-zh.md) · [Home](README.md)

## Responsibilities and changes

The language-specific `research-question-forge-en` and `research-question-forge-zh` folders are installable Skills. SKILL.md handles discovery, routing, and boundaries; references hold detailed rules; agents/openai.yaml holds UI text. Ordinary files rely on language directories rather than repeated suffixes. Root-level bilingual documents retain suffixes. Generated portable guides must not be edited separately.

Describe the concrete failure and intended decision change before editing a module. Avoid accumulating warnings or unnecessary files. Maintain structural, capability, and exception parity manually across languages using natural wording; the builder does not translate. Users may replace disciplinary, institutional, or tool-specific components while preserving question–evidence–decision traceability.

## Build and check

Use Python 3.10 or newer; scripts require only the standard library:

```sh
python scripts/build_guides.py
python scripts/build_guides.py --check
python scripts/validate_structure.py
```

Use `--language en` or `--language zh` for one edition. Checks cover names, the simple YAML/JSON fields used here, UI text, language modules, reference routing, links, generated-file consistency, and selected sensitive patterns. CITATION.cff uses JSON-compatible YAML without invented DOI, release date, or version metadata.

These checks do not validate full YAML/CFF schemas, semantic translation equivalence, citation truth, or research quality. Run an official Skill validator when available. Report actual inputs, outputs, and limitations of behavioral tests; a rule walkthrough is not an execution trial.

## Research regression and release

Review broad wishes, existing answers, counterevidence, theoretical/qualitative work, excessive scope, explicitly authorized revision, and offline use. Workflow checks also include summary stacking, inconsistent drafts, template conflicts, missing full text, and unverified metrics. Repair research judgments and structure before wording.

Public files must contain generic methods or authorized material, not cases extracted from private research, conversations, or sample reports. Isolate suspicious material and flag it rather than propagating it. Scripts do not rewrite Git history. Manually review privacy and rights before release and inspect README, usage, Skill, and portable-guide entry points.

CHANGELOG records capabilities and academic reasons; usage guides omit development history. Preserve the MIT license and attribution. Maintainers manage version tags and GitHub About text; the package does not publish, change account settings, or update installed copies automatically.

## Handoffs to other workflows

Forge does not bind a downstream workflow. Packages embedding its core should record source paths, content hashes, and licensing, then synchronize and validate explicitly. Document changes to decisions, evidence boundaries, and output fields so downstream maintainers can assess impact without adding their writing responsibilities to Forge.
